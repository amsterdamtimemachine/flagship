Amsterdam Time Machine aggregates historical materials from multiple cultural institutions into a single spatial-temporal interface for exploration of the city's heritage. The interface presents each neighbourhood's historical data like a newspaper frontpage, bringing together photographs, texts, and records from different collections into one unified view. 

ATM addresses several challenges in heritage data accessibility. Datasets remain fragmented across institutional silos, requiring researchers to visit multiple archives and databases. Traditional interfaces require users to know what they're looking for in advance, a barrier when available materials are unclear. 

The project originated from our own struggle to find datasets for telling specific stories about Amsterdam. This challenge led us to reframe the approach: rather than using data to tell stories, ATM reveals the story of the data itself. The spatial distribution shows not just where data exists, but where it doesn't. Empty cells and data density patterns raise questions about collection practices, institutional priorities, and historical documentation biases. Why is there less data as you move from Amsterdam's center? Why are certain neighbourhoods extensively documented while others remain blank? 

The interface divides Amsterdam into neighbourhood-sized cells on a geographic heatmap, with a timeline spanning from the 17th century to today in 50-year periods. Both the spatial heatmap and temporal histogram display data density on logarithmic scales. Each cell of the heatmap presents a snapshot of historical data from that neighbourhood at the given time period. 

## How to use it 

ATM serves as an entry point to identify relevant materials from various cultural heritage institutions and historical sources at once, linking directly to the original sources for more in depth information. Data can be filtered simultaneously through four dimensions: spatial (geographic location), temporal (time period), content type, and machine learning-generated topic classifications.  

To start exploring click cells on the heatmap to view data from that area. The resulting panel displays images, texts, and personal records together. The timeline below filters these materials by time period. For instance, selecting a cell in the Jordaan for the 1900-1950 period might reveal photographs of working-class housing alongside newspaper articles about labour strikes. 

Topics filter content using newspaper categories like 'kunst en cultuur' or 'economische zaken. Machine learning assigns these categories to each item in the database, creating thematic connections between data that wouldn't naturally be grouped together. A photograph of a canal house and a newspaper article critiquing modernist architecture might both be tagged with 'architectuur', despite being completely different types of records from different eras. 

This newspaper-based taxonomy was chosen because it provides familiar, period-appropriate categories that researchers and the public already understand, and because newspaper sections historically covered the full spectrum of urban life. Note that this classification system is experimental and its accuracy has not yet been validated. 

## Datasets 

Current data partners are Stadsarchief Amsterdam and Delpher, with additional institutions to follow. The collection spans 17th century to present and includes personal records, newspaper and magazine articles, architectural drawings, and historical photographs.
